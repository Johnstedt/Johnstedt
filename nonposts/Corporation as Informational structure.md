There is seven billion people on this planet and each and every one of them are taking mutiple decisions and actions every day.
Every one of us makes the decisions with limited information, must of them indelibierate, puffering along in our daily life.
This complex mess of disjunct decisions interplay, bounce of each other and makes up the world today. The momentum however will be tomorow.

So how does society change?

That question isn't necesarily political, or atleast shouldn't be. 
My problems with the how we discus <i>what</i> we want the future to be not <i>how</i> it will get there.
And as with any complex system, predicting the outcome from an action is incredibly difficult. Think of the butterfly flapping it's wings in south america causing a typhoon in south east asia.

This is how I see it go down,

I want A to happen(what), so we do B(how) to get to A.

The A is what we end up discussing and arguing about and B will not lead to A anyway.

Consider,

I want to end hunger in Africa, so we ship tons of food there to end hunger.

but what happens is,

I want to end hunger in Africa, so we ship tons of food there,

the local food market will be disrupted by all free food and local producers will go under,
which will furthur increase the unemployment rate and force a downspiral in an already weak economy that caused the hunger in the first place.

My point is simply, before we try to change the world for the better, how does it actually change?

I believe that how the world changes is way more indelierate than political statments and that they are a wishwash of individual actions and systematic products of corporations and other institutions.

In this post I will try to understand how companies and their structure shape the future. 
I think this will be the biggest the single most important factor in how the future will be shaped.

### Information as an evolutionary unit

I'm in the process of traversing Douglas R. Hofstadter's monolith 'Metamagical Themas' and was delighted to find a chapter wholly dedicated to information as an evolutionary agent. Although the book consists of articles published in the early 80s it carries weight in the seemingly ongoing debate about corporations and their allegedly 'greedy' behaviour. How it has affected our society in negative ways yet being the reason for our prosperity.

Christopher Ryan has long hinted that corporations are more of an organism which has it's own goals and incentive which differ from that of the humans it supposedly serve. Although vague, it's a good starting point, and I will try to define it a bit more rigorously. 

Before we begin, I should quickly point out that I dont consider lobbying our illegal activites. I consider the market as free and just. It would only amplify my argument anyway so it wouldn't radically change anything.

### Self replicating information

So let us go bach to 'Metamagical Themas' and the chapter of information as an agent.
The idea that information is it's own evolutionary unit under similar pressure as that of a gene. 
While the idea has become widely known through internet memes it's much more wide and useful than that. 
Hofstadter begins by quoting Roger Sperry

<div style="background-color: #17171c; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">
"Ideas cause ideas and help evolve new ideas.
 They interact with each other and with other mental forces in the same brain,
 in neighboring brains, and, thanks to a global communication, in far distant, foreign brains" 
 - <i>Roger Sperry</i>
</div>

Dawkins definiton
\\

I think of memes as a very practical and useful tool to describe this phenomenon. It's allusion to genes is very powerful because many of the words and ways we explain genes is synonymous with those of memes. Many of the evolutionary processies that selects genes have an equal or similar counterpart for memes. 
\\
Dawkins memes has been to me known for quite some time and it was Hofstadter's quote of Going that brought new light on this topic for me.
Going neatly packages information into larger systems of information. I like to think of them as a collection of memes. A collection that is perfected to spread. 

### Organizations as a collection of Memes

While Dawkins have hinted at larger structures, most notably religion, Going manages to explicitly display the fenomena with some interesting syntax.

Going begins with a sentence:
\\ 
```
Sentence A: 
	It is your duty to convince others that this sentence is true.
```
\\
While it's quite obvious that this sentence will fool noone it is its raw form that is interesting. Going explains it \\

"If you were foolish enough to belive this sentence, you would attempt to convince their friends, an so on until every human mind contained a copy of A. Thus A is a self-replicating sentence. More particularly, it is the intellectual equivalent of a virus. If Sentence A were to enter a mind, it would take control of the mind's intellectual machinery and use it to produce hundreds of copies of itself in outer minds"
\\
Then Going continuous with a more subtle approach...
```
System S 
Begin: 
	S1: Blah. 
	S2: Blah blah. 
	S3: Blah blah blah. 
	.   .
	.   .
	S99: It's your duty to convince others that systme S is true.

```

Religion

The purpose of the genes stand in complete contradiction with the memegroup. and in case of the
munk completely overrides it's vitality.


munk contradiction -> I belive the contradiction between our bodily genes and the memes is at the root of the ever increasing depression rate in our society. And as society continues to 'progress' into deeper and deeper formal structures our bodies will continue to atrofie and plea for the sensory input it's not receiving 

As our society progresses deeper into everly more complex informational structures our behaviour will increasingly become the phenotype of memes rather than genes. Thus pleasure, which comes from genetic phenotyps, will diminish. Corporations and Institutions will prosper upon a increasingly depressed society.

### Financial selection

So memes and religion might be all neat and dandy, but what about corporations?
If one considers memes as evolutionary, corporations would easily follow by

<div style="background-color: #17171c; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px">
	if meme m is under evolutionary pressure e
    m &#8712; e  
    and
    corporation S is a set of memes  
    s = {m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub>, ... , m<sub>n</sub>} 
    then
    s &#8712; e  
</div>

It might be easier to just check against the definition for evolution
which it satisfies by (1) new corporation are created, current corporation are mutible and current corporation can split into two, and (2) corporations are checked by financal selection, corporations that doesn't earn profits nor raise capital ceases to exists.



### Corporal structure




\section{Financial Selection}

Why companies without that structure fail

Arms races, and why voting with your dollar will ultimately fail

Hence Corporations are it's own evolutionary agent, an entity different than the humans in it,
a living being acting often directly opposite to that of human interests

If what I written here above is true what does that leave us for options?
The task of describing a problem is not necesarily the same thing to solving it.
Karl Marxs described thouroghly the problems with the market, his solution was devestating,
The likes of Dawkins and Harris describes religion but only seems to create more hate and a movement very much as fundamental as that of religion. 

There is beauty in an evolutionary agent larger than that of the human body, it can
perfect cars, computers where it reaches ridiculous perfection and simultaneous
create devestation like intellectual monopolies and offshore drilling. Unlike any other institution profit-driven companies can drive 

Alignment with human interests will diverge
