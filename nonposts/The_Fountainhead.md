During my reading I've come across a long array of dismissing quotes of Ayn Rand and her books. So naturally I decided to get to know her work better and read <i>The fountainhead</i>.

To my surprise I found myself enjoying the book greatly and I have a hard time understanding why her work is under such scrutany. I understand that the tone is quite harsh and the descriptive passages might not be that elegant but I cannot find any flaw in the logic nor any problem with the emergent manifestation in the book. It is to me absurd to me how this piece is passed around with words like "As literature, I found the book dry, predictable, and overwrought. As philosophy, I found it circular, wholly unfounded, and completely contradicting reality". Or the judgement on the supposed egoistic assholes that reads it. To be honest I am not really sure the people who supposedly hates it even have read it.

# Critics

Just to be clear, this is not a review nor any sort of critic. This is my own thoughs of the concepts presented in the book. As "" . This post is more a reflection of me rather than Ayn Rand.
