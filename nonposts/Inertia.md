This last weekend I was reminded of I song by a close friend of mine.
My parents held a gathering for me to celebrate that I was home after half a year in China. Naturally many of my relatives and a few close friends was there.

Anyway, as usual, my mother forces the guests to write a couple of words in the infamouse guest book.

One of my closest friends that I cycled Milano - Barcelona for more than two years ago now quoted 'Time' by Pink Floyed.

I was obsessed with that song the period before and during our cycling trip. 

I wonder how much of so called 'success' is an invertion of life quality
