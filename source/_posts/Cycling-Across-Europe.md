### Introduction

How do you decide to cross a continent on a bike? Why
did I spend a summer peddling across Europe, sleeping in a tent and eating canned tuna? \\
I've been pondering that for a while now, mostly because
I've been asked that too many times.\\
I don't really have an answer either, it certainly an act of desperation, not finding satisfaction in a sedentary lifestyle. The boredom. . To cycle away from Huddinge, Stockholm is however the best decision I've ever made. The wonderful people, the amazing places. \\ \\
This is an account of the trip I did the summer of 2016, cycling past ten countries to reach my end destination, The Colosseum in Rome.

### Leaving home
I can't stress enough how little planing and packing I did. Planning creates expectations and kind of ruins the experience of the road where few things are predictable. So i kept planning to a minimal. I already owned a decent bike and front panniers and I borrowed a tent and a trianga kitchen from my parents. The only thing I bought was a couple of back panniers.
Then I filled the bags with clothes and food and I was on my way.

## Sweden
To peddle away from the house I grew up in, knowing that cycling is what I will be doing the next couple of months, is definitely a weird state of mind.
The first 10 minutes was special, it's the same ride as on my commute to school for three years
of my life. This time it wasn't a commute. \\

I managed to navigate from the top of my head for the first couple hours.
I've cycled to Södertälje before, so I need the road

### Wild camping

### The Heroes of Broaryd

When I was about to pass the little village Broaryd one of the wheels spoke broke in the middle.
Usually a wheel can function without one of the spoke but not this wheel, each rotation
it got stuck in the frame. It was impossible to cycle with it. So naturally I had to start walking, pushing
the bike along.
    Moments like these make bicycle touring fascinating, they make you completely vulnerable.
