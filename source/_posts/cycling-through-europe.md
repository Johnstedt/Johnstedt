# The Decision of Indecision

I kept having these nightmares, or others might call them just dreams because there was nothing inherently scary with them. In the dream I would wake up, being ten years older than I am now. I would eat my breakfast and go to a stable high paying engineering job. It might not sound like a nightmare but it left me terrified. I assume it symbolize a soul stuck in the hamster wheel, to comfortable to break free. Every day working myself closer to the grave, becoming more and more atrophied in mind and body every day. The dream showed me a life of lightness, a comfortable, easy but depressingly boring life.  

I never told anyone before, but that was the reason I packed my bicycle to cycle across Europe. The 3500km journey that would eventually end by dragging my bike into the Mediterranean. And I would do it alone. I chose to add the burden of the journey to my life to try to make it meaningful. To make it heavy.

The dream acted as a forcing function, it showed me what my life would become if I didn't make a tough decision. Or rather that dream would be my decision if I stayed home.
It's like the Indian monkey trap. The trap works by having an empty coconut chained to a tree. The coconut have some rice in it and the monkey can fit his hand into it an feel the rice. However the hole is just small enough so the monkey can't get his closed fist out. The monkey is stuck, the notion "hold on to food" doesn't really work in this scenario. The monkey ends up standing there, not wanting to leave the food, until the hunter comes to fetch his dinner. The monkey standing there wondering which decision to take is actually taking the decision. His decision is to stand there and become dinner.
To not end up like the monkey, taking the decision of indecisiveness, I had to do something drastic. So I walked out the front door and cycled south...

# The Immediacy of Life on the Road

I find the problems that arise in regular life to be anxiety inducing ones. There's always some deadline or requirement in the back of your head causing constant discomfort. They stretch out for long periods of time and eats away at you. 
The problems when cycling however are instead panic inducing ones, something goes wrong and you're forced to deal with it directly. 
   
### The Heros of Broaryd   
An example of this was when a spoke broke in the middle of nowhere in rural Småland, Sweden. I had no tools to fix it and 25km to nearest city which was in the wrong direction. So I simply started to push the bike along. After a few minutes of pushing I arrived into the small little village of Broaryd. A man mowing his lawn was the first of my encounter and I naturally asked for help. The friendly man quickly ran away to fetch his repairing kit but could not really do anything with a spoke snapped in half. Instead of letting me on my way he was determined to help. 
"I can't help you" he said, "but my neighbors are usually quite handy".
So we started to go around the neighborhood knocking doors. Most of the neighbors enticed the same determination but noone had a spoke with the right length laying around(which I guess would be a quite odd thing to have). On the fifth door however a man in his 70s with the name of Gunnar opened. He asked me to come along and we checked his garage without any luck.
"We will fix this" he noted, "if we don't fix it today you can sleep here". I was amazed by his willingness to take responsibility of my problem, how he managed to transfer the weight from my shoulders to his. He knew a bike enthusiast in the neighboring village so we drove there. His friend had quite the set of spokes but they weren't the right length so we headed back to Broaryd again. I met his wife and over a cup of coffee I got to know them. They turned out to be a real power couple. They met on a sailing boat going from Copenhagen to India in the 60s, spent 16 years building hospitals in Nepal among a lot of other things. They openly shared their life experience with me and showed me their current work helping immigrants settle and integrate in the community. Since it was sunday every bicycle store in was close. So I spent the night and in the morning their neighbor drove me into Smålandsstenar where I was able to get a new spoke for my bicycle.

My bicycle would continue to break down during the journey. Following Elbe in Germany the screw holding my front pannier broke in half which I solved by using the U of a padlock to keep it together. That solution held all the way through most of Czech Republic until it snapped again. I relied on duck tape until I found a mechanic who had a screw with the correct size in northern Austria.
   
Every evening you're tasked with finding a tenting spot, a ws host to stay at or hostel. Finding places to find becomes a regular event where have to leave the bike and it's bag with someone who can guard it or where it's clearly visible from inside the store.
   
There is such an immediacy to the problem solving on the road. You're forced to deal with the task at hand, contrast that to our modern society with great latency. I find that solving problems with this kind of immediacy is more satisfying and less stressful in the long term. One could make the case that this way of life better mimics the environment our species developed up until agriculture started to take place. That it is preferable to todays never ending anxiety-inducing way of life. 

# The danger of danger's absence

Our evolved society today have a almost eradicated the dangers that used to face our specie. 
The biological systems for fear is however still deeply rooted in ourselves and in a hyper-safe environment as most of the west this fear system can turn inwards. Without the prospect of real dangers our fear system turns on everyday occurrences like public speaking, deadlines or other essential "non-fearful" acts. Our once helpful for survival fear has become very much like our immune system described by the Hygiene Hypothesis. The hypothesis basically states that in the absent of external threats the body's immune system can attack the body itself. Which in turn can cause a number of autoimmune diseases. I think we have reached something similar with fear, without any real threat we've become fearful of the harmless or the unlikely.

### Stuck in a Thunderstorm 
Leaving the flatlands in eastern Austria along the Hungarian border I cycled up into the alps and the mountains. I thought it would be cool to sleep close to the top so after a brutal climb up I started to look around for a place to put up the tent. There was a dirty trail leading up to the top and to the sides were trees suitable to hide a tent in.I pitched the tent, ate and went to sleep.
At 4 am an approaching thunder storm woke me up. The rain was aggressively smashing the tent and the lightnings turned the pitch-black night into a white flash before becoming black again. The lightnings were still far away and I could count to 15 seconds between light and thunder(ca 5km away). But the formation of the landscape and my location on the top made the sound bounce making it unbearably loud. To my horror the eye of the storm was heading closer and the time between lightning an thunder was shortening. I laid there silently, counting the seconds and the distance, waiting until the lightnings would start to hit my immediate surroundings. 
Four seconds. Three seconds. Two seconds. One second.
The lightning and the enormous bang were instant, the darkness became white, the ground was shaking. I was certain one of the trees were to fall onto me at any second. Some more close strikes followed but no tree fell. The thunders eventually moved away, I tried to count the frequency of lightnings and came to the conclusion that around every 20th second a new lightning would strike. At around 6 am the thunders died down, letting me fall asleep again.

### Tent Sailing   
After taking the ferry from Rødby to Puttgarden and heading for a campground the weather turned bad. When I arrived to the campground in heavy rain and wind speed at 25 m/s.
I must have looked foolish trying to pitch the tent in. When I got in the first tent pole the tent form resembled a D and worked more like a sail than a tent in the wind. I had more trouble keeping the tent from blowing away and it was impossible to get the other pole in at the same time.
After a few painful minutes a German came up to me asking what the hell I was doing. He offered me to sleep in their caravan and I gladly accepted.

### Sleeping outdoors   
There is a certain thrill to pitch a tent on private land next to the road that is hard to describe. In countries like Germany and Italy where private land and property is taken with a high degree of seriousness. The risk of being found by an ill willing land owner might be small, but it still looms over the tent as the shadows becomes larger until complete darkness.

Cycling across a continent elevates the level of danger that properly adjust our fear to normal levels, it helps to realize what situations that you actually should be fearful of and which you should not.

# Leverage-less Conversations

Naturally it takes time for us to entrust friends an colleagues with our secrets and peculiarities. We don't want to give away information that could be used against us as leverage or gossip. Like politicians we navigate conversations to not give away leverage or any meaning for that matter. Conversations then becomes dull. About nothing. No true meaning or value is exchanged.

Cycling changes that. Since I only stayed for one or two nights at the same place there is no change of using our conversations as leverage with mutual friends or colleagues. This seemingly opens up the possibility to deeper conversations directly skipping all the pointless smalltalk.

The subset of people you meet is also the subset you want to meet. It's the oddballs, the ones that have great empathy and interesting stories to share. The ones that offer you help are also the nicest ones which you, conveniently, want to get to know. Many of my encounters were with members of the community Warmshowers. Warmshowers is a collective of touring cyclists that offer to host other touring cyclists. There's a certain quality of these hosts that offer up their homes for free. Many challenges the social norm of how you should live your life and openly shares their struggles trying to create an interesting beautiful life.

Since private conversations should be kept in private. A forth of the nights were spent on the floors or sofas of complete strangers for free. Going for eight weeks the sheer volume of encounters should give a hint. 

# The wonders of being lost

In my youth I spent three weeks in England learning English. I had an amazing teacher that tried to teach us the more nuances of English. There was this one monologue of his that I remember very clearly. "Does anyone know the difference between walking and wandering?" he said in his very brusque way that made the classroom completely quiet, "Walking is active with a purpose, you walk to the beach. The purpose of wandering however is the wandering itself. The immense joy of just wandering about".
   I, more or less, wandered through Europe. The purpose was not to get to the Mediterranean, the purpose was the journey itself. Thus my path through the continent was not always the most efficient one. I seldom checked the map, sometimes just looking at the sun when faced with multiple roads choosing the most southern one. This inevitably led me to some very strange places and I ended with a mantra of my own, "You haven't been to a city if you haven't been lost in it". 
   
Leaving the urban parts of Prague, I came in to this path that kept getting more and more narrow and eventually became a dirty/hike path through the forest. I checked the map and realized that I was pretty much in nowhere. I was presented with two choices. Either I could continue on the path for 3km or I could cycle back and take normal roads ending up at roughly 10km. Being who I am there was really only one choice so I headed onto the rootfilled forest path. Those three kilometers ended up taking me a bit more than two hours. Multiple times I had to carry the bike over big rocks and my panniers were often too wide for the path. For some parts I ended up carrying one of the panniers with my teeth whilst forcibly pushing the bike with my arms. There was a few hikers on the path as well giving me some concerning stares. I must have looked ridiculous pushing my fully loaded road bike on a narrow hiking trail. 
   
Sadly I was too occupied with pushing my bike that I didn't take any photos of my struggles, however there's this footage from the trail before it got too narrow and rocky.

Climbing up a small road up a mountainside in Austria, a bit west of Graz, I once again encountered a hiking trail. Being roughly in the same situation as before, push through for 5km or head down the mountain and go around taking 15km(losing altitude) I chose to go forward.
The trail was in a better state than that one in Czech Republic but it was steep. The trail eventually lead all the way to the top of the mountain. The climb at the bottom of the road that lead to the trail started at 350m a.s.l and the hike trail topped out at 1280m a.s.l, making a total climb of 950 meters.

The uncertainty is the beauty, that is the essence of adventure. These are the things you remember. The unusualness of the experience tangled with the challenge, difficulty and the surrounding environment makes the moments beautiful and lasting. We're born too late to explore new land, too early to explore space yet there's something new, frontierial and exciting about it. 

# The Savage Beauty in Between

The most obvious thing to note when traveling is the places you get to see. One could go into details about the magnificent geography I saw. It's of course great, but everyone already knows that. When cycling, to contrast normal travel, you see everything. You traverse the landscape at the pace of a snail. You feel the hills in your legs, the city smog in your lungs and the rain in the face. Rather than to 'teleport' between cities and noteworthy compounds you experience the interconnectedness between it all. The landscape shifting from flatlands to mountains, from urban to rural. You get to see culture and dialect slowly change until it's a completely different language or society. You get a feel for the distance between it all. The size of cities and countries, and how much is rural or urban. You receive a completely different view of what exactly makes up Europe and I think it's hard to do it any other way.

To go from the flatlands of Burgerland, Austria to up in the alps. Climbing up the passes, gliding down into deep valleys. Then abruptly leaving it to the obscurely flat northern Italy. To reach the great rivers of Donau(Donube) and Elbe to follow them for a while. To slowly cycle from rural area into the suburbs and then to the center of the amazing cities of Europe, Copenhagen, Dresden, Prague, Vienna(Wien), Bratislava, Graz, Venizia(Venice), Firenze(Florence) and of course Rome. To experience small little villages on the way that no one would ever come across on a conventional trip: Broaryd(Sweden), Lenzen(Germany), Neukirchen(Germany), Ratzeburg(Germany), Jerichow(Germany, Snéžník(Czech), Mailberg(Austria), Modriarch(Austria), Villadose(Italy) to name a few.
To see Europe from the bicycle is indescribably amazing.

# A Continent Crossed

<iframe width="600" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PscoflJyaU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mediterranean Ocean close to Orbetello, Italy.*

Dragging my bicycle out into the vast Mediterranean ocean marked the end of a continent. A few days later I rolled in to Rome, the Vatican and the Colosseum. Of course I was satisfied by my accomplishment, enjoying the fact that I had gone from the house I grew up in to such historical sites and tropical landscape. But the goal of my journey was the journey itself, not the Mediterranean ocean nor Rome. As I spent the few days in Rome, walking around the sites and prepared the flight home, I was left with this existential feeling... 

What now? 

I was still fumbling in the dark. I hadn't figured out who I was, nor found much of meaning. I felt as if I had just added a few random discrete experiences to the entity that is me. Taking me farther away from an answer to what the heck I want to do with my life. Flying home to Sweden for another year of University didn't directly fill my lust to live deliberately.  
    
If this trip symbolizes life as a whole I would say that there's not a golden pot in the end. As the journey was the goal not Rome, life shouldn't be spent reaching a far off goal, but be spent on life itself.
